Instructions:
Attached you can find the jupyter notebook and the datasets.

Please answer all questions:
- First with pandas (python)
- Then in SQL

Show the results in a few plots or tables with the library of your choice.

Data Description:
The main data are in the csv file : order_data.csv

- createdAt : the order creation timestamp
- status : the order status (complete, canceled, etc.)
- restaurantName : the restaurant name attached to the order
- pickupDeadline : timestamp corresponding to the ETA of the driver in the restaurant
- driverArrivedAtRestaurantAt : timestamp corresponding to the arrival time of the driver in the restaurant
- pickedAt : timestamp corresponding to the driver picking the food in the restaurant

The restaurant area data are in the csv file : restaurantarea_data.csv

- restaurantName : the restaurant name
- area : the speaking area for the restaurant

Data Preparation:
Take the data from the 2021-01-25 to 2021-01-31 and only consider complete orders and remove the orders with missing timestamps.

Questions:
- What are the most popular restaurants in number of orders ?
- At which time of the day do we have a peak in average ? ex : between 11:00 and 12:00 ? between 18:00 and 19:00 ?
- For each restaurant compute the average waiting time for the driver : pickedAt - driverArrivedAtRestaurantAt
- If the waiting time is to high (> 6min), add a warning flag to the restaurant
- Make a join with the restaurant's area data and compute the waiting time per area
